# Write a Perl program, tags.pl which given the URL of a web page fetches it by running wget and prints the HTML tags it uses.
# The tag should be converted to lower case and printed in sorted order with a count of how often each is used.
# 
# Don't count closing tags.
# 
# Make sure you don't print tags within HTML comments.
