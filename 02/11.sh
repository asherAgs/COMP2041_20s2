# Implement a shell script, grades.sh, that reads a sequence of (studentID, mark) pairs from its standard input, and writes (studentID, grade) pairs to its standard output. The input pairs are written on a single line, separated by spaces, and the output should use a similar format. The script should also check whether the second value on each line looks like a valid mark, and output an appropriate message if it does not The script can ignore any extra data occurring after the mark on each line.
