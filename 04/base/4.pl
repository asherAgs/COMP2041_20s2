# Write a simple version of the head command in Perl, that accepts an optional command line argument in the form -n, where n is a number, and displays the first n lines from its standard input. If the -n option is not used, then the program simply displays the first ten lines from its standard input.
# Examples of use:

#   perl head.pl <file2        # display first ten lines of file2
#   ...
#   perl head.pl -10 <file2     # same as previous command
#   ...
#   perl head.pl -5 <file2      # display first five lines of file2
#   ...
