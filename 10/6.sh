# Write a shell script called check that looks for duplicated student ids in a file of marks for a particular subject. The file consists of lines in the following format:
#   2233445 David Smith 80
#   2155443 Peter Smith 73
#   2244668 Anne Smith 98
#   2198765 Linda Smith 65
# The output should be a list of student ids that occur 2+ times, separated by newlines. (i.e. any student id that occurs more than once should be displayed on a line by itself on the standard output).
