Consider the following columnated (space-delimited) data file containing marks information for a single subject:

2111321 37 FL
2166258 67 CR
2168678 84 DN
2186565 77 DN
2190546 78 DN
2210109 50 PS
2223455 95 HD
2266365 55 PS
...
Assume that the student number occurs at the beginning of the line, that the file is sorted on student number, and that nobody scores 100.

Give calls to the sort filter to display the data:

In order on student number

in ascending order on mark

in descending order on mark

Give calls to the egrep filter to select details of:

students who failed

students who scored above 90
students with even student numbers

Give a pipeline to print:

the details for the top 10 students (ordered by mark)

the details for the bottom 5 students (ordered by mark)

Assuming that the command cut -d' ' -f 3 can extract just the grades (PS, etc.), write a pipeline to show how many people achieved each grade (i.e. the grade distribution). E.g. for the above data:

    1 CR
    3 DN
    1 FL
    1 HD
    2 PS
