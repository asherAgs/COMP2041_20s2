COMP2041 student Nelson wrote this script named start_lab03.sh to run before the Week 3 lab.

    #!/bin/sh
    cd ~/labs/03
    ex1=jpg2png
    ex2=email_image
    ex3=date_image
    ex4=tag_music

But when he ran his script, it didn't seem to work:
pwd

    /home/z1234567
    ./start_lab03.sh
    pwd
    /home/z1234567
    echo $ex1 $ex2 $ex3 $ex4
