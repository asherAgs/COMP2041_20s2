Course Summary
This course is designed for students who have mastered the basics of programming. It aims to broaden your knowledge of techniques and tools for software construction.

Assumed Knowledge
Before commencing this course, students should ...

have a sound understanding of a procedural programming language such as C or Python;
be able to produce a correct procedural program from a spec;
have an understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms (sorting, searching);
appreciate the use of abstraction in computing.
For undergraduate (COMP2042) students, the above material will typically have been covered in COMP1511 (or its predecessor, COMP1917) and COMP2521 (or its predecessor, COMP1927).

For postgraduate (COMP9042) students, the above material will have been covered in COMP9021 and COMP9024, or in equivalent courses in their undergraduate degree.

A significant fraction of the class has previously used the C programming language, and some knowledge of that language may be assumed during some lecture examples. Students who have not programmed C (or C++) may need to do some extra reading to understand these examples.
